### Create a Linux File System to run in QEMU

##### Alejandro Cendejas

# HOW TO USE

1. Clone this repository

2. Run `script.sh` with a sudo-enabled user. The script will ask for superuser privilege to install possibly missing dependencies, create a loopback device, format the disk image, and install the bootloader.

3. That's it! Hope you like it.

# NOTES

I didn't include any signature or checksum checks... I'm a bit tight on time.
